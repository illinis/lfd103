introduction to exploring linux kernel sources

Linux Mainline

"I prefer creating a separate workspace (not under my home directory) for my upstream work to explore git repositories." -lfd103

clone linux master branch
clone linux mainline

git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux_mainline

the bulk of the kernel code lives under the drivers subdirectory.

"Take a look at the Makefile and MAINTAINERS files in the main directory and scripts/get_maintainer.pl and scripts/checkpatch.pl. You will be using them in your everyday kernel development life.

Play with cregit or git log to look at the history of source files in each of the kernel areas. You can look at individual commits and generate a patch or two using

git format-patch -1 <commit ID>

as shown in the example presented in this screenshot."
